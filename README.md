# Flight_Delay_Predictor_Team1
Repository for ML project on Flight Delay Predictor 

Flight delays are a persistent challenge in the aviation industry, causing widespread disruptions, financial losses, and reduced customer satisfaction. Understanding the factors that contribute to these delays is essential for improving operational efficiency and enhancing the travel experience. The Flight Delay Dataset (2018â€“2022), provides a comprehensive repository of historical flight information, enabling an in-depth analysis of delay patterns and trends across the United States.
This dataset encompasses a wide range of critical features, including airline performance, flight schedules, departure and arrival delays, airport congestion, and seasonal variations. With over four years of detailed data, it offers valuable insights into the operational dynamics of the aviation industry and the underlying causes of flight disruptions.
Leveraging this dataset, this project aims to develop a robust machine learning model to predict the probability of flight delays or cancellations. By analyzing key variables such as carrier performance, departure schedules, and airport traffic, the model will provide accurate and actionable predictions. The project will also feature a user-friendly interface that empowers passengers to make informed travel decisions and helps airlines optimize their operations by identifying bottlenecks and improving schedule reliability.
Through predictive insights and actionable analytics, this project seeks to address the challenges of flight delays and cancellations, offering innovative solutions to enhance customer satisfaction, improve operational resilience, and contribute to a more efficient aviation ecosystem.
